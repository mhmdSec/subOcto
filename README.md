# subOcto
## How it works ?
The tool is designed to get Subdomains as As much as possible.

So you have to:
1. Go to `https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl` and make an experimental try to get `history` from the link :  
`https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2025-12-30/website.com` to use it in our tool.
2. You should install `subfinder` tool too in your System.
3. And install The Requirements.txt by `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
## How to use it ?
1. Run the tool by ``python subOcto.py``.
2. Add the domain , Then add the Date.
3. And let the tool runs and wait the result in a Filtered Text File called `yourdomain_subs.txt`
4. You've get a full filtered list of sub domains.  
## Features
1. Auto-Filtering: Automatically removes duplicate subdomains found by both sources.
2. Sorting: Results are saved in alphabetical order for better readability.
3. Dual-Source: Combines historical web data with active tool discovery.
4. The tool depends on 3 main resources: `subdomainfinder.c99.nl` , `subfinder tool` and `shrewdeye.app`
